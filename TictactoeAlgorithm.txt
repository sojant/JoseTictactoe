536 CROWLEY AND SIEGLER TABLE 1 Model of Expert Performance 

Win 
If there is o row, column, or diagonal with two of my pieces and o blank space,
Then ploy the blank space (thus wlnnlng the gome). 

Block 
If there Is a row, column, or diagonal with two of my opponent’s pieces and a blank space,
Then play the blank space (thus blocking a potential win for my opponent). 

Fork 
If there are two intersecting rows, columns, or diagonals with one of my pieces and two blonks, and 
If the intersecting space Is empty,
Then move to the intersecting space (thus creating two woys to win on my next turn). 

Block Fork 
If there are two intersecting rows, columns, or diagonals with one of my opponent’s pieces ond two blanks, and 
If the intersecting space is empty,
Then 
    If there is an empty location that creates a two-in-o-row for me (thus forcing my opponent to block rather than fork),
    Then move to the location.  (as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork)
    Else move to the Intersection space (thus occupying the location that my opponent could use to fork).

Play Center 
If the center is blank,
Then play the center. 

Play Opposite Corner 
If my opponent is in a corner, and 
If the opposite corner is empty,
Then play the opposite corner. 

Play Empty Corner 
If there Is an empty corner,
Then move to an empty corner. 

Play Empty Side 
If there Is an empty side,
The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
